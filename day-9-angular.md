## 📌 What I Worked On Today

Today was all about **strengthening fundamentals** and **connecting concepts across C#, ASP.NET, and Angular**.

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered

### 🔹 C# Access Modifiers
- `public` – accessible everywhere
- `private` – accessible only within the class
- `protected` – accessible within class and derived classes
- `internal` – accessible within the same assembly
- `protected internal` – combination of protected + internal

✔️ Learned how access modifiers help in **encapsulation and code safety**

### 🔹 ASP.NET Fundamentals
- What ASP.NET is and why it is used
- Role of ASP.NET in building **web applications & APIs**
- Understanding request–response lifecycle at a high level

---

### 🔹 Features & Benefits of ASP.NET
- High performance
- Cross-platform support
- Built-in dependency injection
- Scalable and secure architecture
- Easy integration with front-end frameworks like Angular

---

### 🔹 Namespace
- Used to organize code and avoid class name conflicts
- Improves readability and maintainability
- Example:
  ```csharp
  namespace MyApplication.Services
  {
      class UserService { }
  }
