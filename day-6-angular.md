# Day 6 – Angular Fundamentals & Signals
📅 Date: 28/01/2026  
⏰ Status: Completed (Hands-on + Concepts)

---

## ✅ Topics Covered

### 1. Angular Data Binding
- Interpolation (`{{ }}`)
- Property Binding (`[property]`)
- Event Binding (`(event)`)
- Two-Way Binding (`[(ngModel)]`)

Understanding:
- One-way data flow vs two-way synchronization
- When to use each binding type

---

### 2. Angular Variables & Data Types
- string
- number
- boolean
- array
- object

Best practices:
- Use meaningful variable names
- Prefer `const` where mutation is not required

---

### 3. Structural Directives
- `*ngIf`
- `*ngFor`
- `*ngSwitch`

Key Learning:
- `*ngFor` syntax difference (older vs new versions)
- Track items efficiently
- Avoid unnecessary loops

---

### 4. Angular Signals (Intro)
- Signal as a reactive state container
- Cleaner alternative to traditional change detection
- Used for predictable UI updates

Example idea:
- Updating UI without manual subscriptions

---

### 5. Sidebar Navigation (Practice)
- Created sidebar layout
- Routed pages:
  - Variables
  - Data Binding
  - Signal
- Active route highlighting

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Angular UI reacts to state changes
- Signals simplify state management
- Structural directives control DOM efficiently
- Clean structure improves debugging

---

## 📌 Notes
- Avoid heavy logic inside templates
- Keep components small and focused
- UI should reflect state, not control it
