## 📌 What I Worked On Today

### 🔹 Angular (Frontend)
- Watched videos on **CSS Flexbox & Grid**
- Understood:
  - Flexbox for **1D layouts**
  - Grid for **2D layouts**
  - When to use Flex vs Grid in real projects
- Applied concepts mentally to Angular components layout

---

### 🔹 Backend (.NET / ASP.NET)
- Studied **Entity Framework**
  - What EF is (ORM)
  - Why EF is used
  - Entity, DbContext, DbSet
- Clear understanding of:
  - How EF simplifies database access
  - How EF fits inside ASP.NET Web API
- Compared:
  - **Web API vs Entity Framework**
  - Learned they work *together*, not as alternatives

---

### 🔹 Core Concepts Revision
- Access Modifiers (public, private, protected, internal)
- Namespace & Assembly basics
- ASP.NET fundamentals:
  - Features
  - Benefits
  - Why it’s used in industry

---

### 🔹 Productivity Reality Check
- Planned to balance:
  - Internship learning
  - GATE preparation
- Reality:
  - GATE prep still pending 😬
  - Need better time blocks from tomorrow

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings / Takeaways

- Layout matters as much as logic (Flex & Grid)
- Entity Framework saves time but fundamentals still matter
- Web API = communication layer  
  Entity Framework = data access layer
- Skipping basics today makes frameworks harder tomorrow

---

## 📝 Notes for Tomorrow
- Start **GATE preparation (at least 1 subject overview)**
- Revise today’s Angular layout concepts with practice
- Continue .NET video playlist
- Post informative + non-repetitive content on GFG Connect

---

## 🔚 Day Summary
A steady learning day with:
- Frontend layout concepts
- Backend architecture clarity
- Realization: consistency > motivation

Wrapping up at **6:30 PM** ✔  
End of Day 10 🚀
