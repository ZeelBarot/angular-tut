# 📅 Day 10 – Real Project Setup & Dependency Understanding
**Date:** 03/02/2026  
**Time Wrapped:** 6:35 PM  

---

## 🎯 Focus of the Day
- Getting familiar with a **real production-level project**
- Cloning repository and working with **branches**
- Understanding **project structure & dependencies**
- Resolving build and runtime dependency issues

---

## 🛠️ What I Worked On Today

### 🔹 Project Setup
- Cloned the real project repository
- Switched between branches to match required setup
- Explored solution structure (API, Model, DataAccess, Repository layers)

### 🔹 Dependency Handling
- Faced multiple build-time errors related to:
  - Missing project references
  - Namespace mismatches
  - Assembly dependency failures
- Understood how:
  - One failed project causes cascading failures in dependent projects
  - Proper project references are critical in layered architecture

### 🔹 Debugging & Learning
- Analyzed build logs to trace **root cause errors**
- Learned to focus on **first failing project** instead of chasing all errors
- Senior developer guided me through:
  - Correct branch selection
  - Fixing dependency and reference issues
  - Understanding how real teams handle broken builds

---

## 📚 Key Learnings

- Real projects are **very different** from tutorial projects
- Dependency issues are normal when working with:
  - Multi-project solutions
  - Different branches
- Fixing the **root error** fixes many downstream errors
- Asking seniors and observing their debugging approach is a big learning boost

---

## 🧠 Today’s Takeaway

> “Understanding project structure and dependencies is as important as writing code.”

---

## 🔜 Next Steps
- Complete dependency resolution
- Successfully build the solution
- Run the API locally
- Start understanding business flow of the project

---

## ✅ Day Status
- Errors still exist, but **progress is real**
- Actively learning from senior guidance
- Moving forward with confidence 🚀
